In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of XX bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at YY bits per second, is he prone to errors?

If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int x,y;
	
	cin>>x;
	cin>>y;
	
	if(x<y)
	cout<<"YES";
	else
	cout<<"NO";
	
	
	return 0;
}
