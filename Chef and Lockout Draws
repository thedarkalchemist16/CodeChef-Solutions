Bob and Alice are having a lockout match between them. There are three problems in the contest worth AA, BB, and CC points respectively. Only the first player to solve a problem gets points for that problem. It is impossible for Bob and Alice to solve a problem at the same time. Chef wants to know if there is any chance of a draw if Bob and Alice manage to solve all 33 problems. A draw occurs when both players end with equal number of points.
