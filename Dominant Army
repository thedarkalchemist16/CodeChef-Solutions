In the medieval age, there were 33 kingdoms AA, BB, and CC. The army of these kingdom had N_AN 
A
​
 , N_BN 
B
​
 , and N_CN 
C
​
  soldiers respectively.

You are given that an army with XX soldiers can defeat an army with YY soldiers only if X \gt YX>Y.

An army is said to be dominant if it can defeat both the other armies combined. For example, kingdom CC's army will be dominant only if N_C \gt N_A + N_BN 
C
​
 >N 
A
​
 +N 
B
​
 .

Determine whether any of the armies is dominant or not.



 
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i=0;i<t;i++)
	{
	    int x,y,z;
	    cin>>x;
	    cin>>y;
	    cin>>z;
	    
	    if((z>x+y) || (x>y+z) || (y>z+x))
	    cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	    else
	    cout<<"NO"<<endl;	}
	return 0;
