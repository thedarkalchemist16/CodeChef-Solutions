In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int t,n;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int n;
         cin >> n;
         cout << int(sqrt(n)) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
