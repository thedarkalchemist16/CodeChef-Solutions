“You won’t get caught if you hide behind someone.”

Sang-Woo advises Gi-Hun to hide behind someone to avoid getting shot.

Gi-Hun follows Sang-Woo's advice and hides behind Ali, who saved his life earlier. Gi-Hun and Ali both have the same height, KK. Many players saw this trick and also started hiding behind Ali.

Now, there are NN players standing between Gi-Hun and Ali in a straight line, with the i^{\text{th}}i 
th
  player having height H_iH 
i
​
 . Gi-Hun wants to know the minimum number of players who need to get shot so that Ali is visible in his line of sight.
